What a brilliant idea! For the longest time HTML5 specified, and advised developers, that it no longer mattered what the number (1 to 6) was in a heading element (when used in conjunction with sectioning elements). What mattered was the nesting level of the H1-h6 in sectioning elements, just like the XTML promised land, but […]

<article>        The woes of date input

        January 19th, 2016 by Ian Devlin
        One of the many new input types that HTML5 introduced is the date input type which, in theory, should allow a developer to provide the user with a simple, usable, recognisable method of entering a date on a web page. But sadly, this input type has yet to reach its full potential. Briefly, the date […]

        ARIA is an amazing technology, it allows developers to add meaning to meaningless HTML or override meaning on HTML that is being repurposed and sometimes misused, so that users who rely upon the meaning of HTML, as implemented in browsers, can understand and interact with HTML User Interfaces successfully.

        On HTML belts and ARIA braces (The Default Implicit ARIA semantics they didn’t want you to know about)

        April 14th, 2015 by Steve Faulkner
        The question of whether HTML elements need the addition of ARIA role attibutes to expose their semantics, is one that surfaces on a regular basis. The answer is maybe for a subset of elements, but increasingly no.

        HTML5 – Check it Before you Wreck it with Mike[tm] Smith

        December 9th, 2014 by Steve Faulkner
        The W3C’s Mike[tm] Smith (AKA @sideshowbarker) is the man with his head in the W3C validation markup checking tool source code; he makes the magic happen.  Questions were asked for the HTML5 Doctor reader’s delight and edification.

        The ride to 5

        October 28th, 2014 by Steve Faulkner
        Forwards In recent weeks I contacted around 40 people, a cross section of those who have banged away at, or banged on about, HTML5. I asked them for their perspectives on HTML5 becoming a W3C Recommendation. Below are the words of the 28 people who responded, pretty much in the order they hit my inbox: […]

        The W3C App Manifest specification

        By Marcos Cáceres and Bruce Lawson. Update 26 September 2014 The initial work for Manifest in Chromium M39 is done, and Marcos (more or less) finished coding the processor a few months ago. “I’m hoping to see it in fxos 2.2“, he said from the pool of his gorgeous Malibu home.) Update 11 November 2014 […]

        Using ARIA in HTML

        June 21st, 2014 by Steve Faulkner
        ARIA (WAI-ARIA if you want to be formal) is a set of attributes that you can add to HTML elements. These attributes communicate role, state and property semantics to assistive technologies via the accessibility APIs implemented in browsers. The W3C HTML specification provides information about which ARIA attributes are allowed to be used on each […]

        Responsive images – end of year report

        November 12th, 2013 by Bruce Lawson
        It’s nearly two years since I suggested a <picture> element as a strawman proposal as a way to solve the problem of responsive images, so let’s have a look at how we’re doing.
